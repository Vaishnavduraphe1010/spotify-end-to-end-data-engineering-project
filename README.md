# spotify End-To-End Data Engineering Project

### Introduction
In this project, I have build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API on AWS. The pipeline will retrieve data from the Spotify API, transform it to desired format, and load it into an AWS data store.

### Services Used
1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable object storage service that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is commonly used to store and distribute large media files, data backups, and static website files.
2. **AWS Lambda:** Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
3. **AWS Cloud Watch:** Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and the applications you run on them. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.
4. **AWS Glue Crawler:** AWS Glue Crawler is a fully managed service that automatically crawls your data sources, identifies data formats, and infers schemas to create an AWS Glue Data Catalog.
5. **Amazon Athena:** Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
